The problem with HTML is that it's static. It can't interact with the user.

To make a webpage interact, JavaScript needs to be added. 

In this quick tutorial, we are going to drag and drop our way to learning how HTML and JavaScript works together.

Our goal is to code a little number-guesser game with five clickable buttons.

If the user guesses too high, they're asked to guess lower. If they guess too low, they're told to guess higher. If they guess the right number, they're congratulated.

To start, we just need to get the HTML in place. We're experts at web page development, so I'll let you tackle that on your own.

Good.

As you can see in the HTML, there are five buttons. And each one calls a method called playTheGame when they are clicked. Let's code that JavaScript method.

First, add the open and close script tags.

Inside the script, create a variable to hold the magic number to be guessed.

Then declare your method.

Notice the method includes an open brace. We will have to match that with a closing brace later.

Declare a varaible named response to hold the text to be displayed to the user after they click on a button.

Implement the logic needed to deal with a guess that's too high. Note that you must close the if statements open brace.

Now handle the condition where the user guessed too low.

Now implement the logic for when the user guessed the magic number correctly.

There's a DIV tag on the webpage with an id of 'results'. Update the inner HTML of this DIV tag and then close the method.

Close the body and html tags and you're done with the drag and drop.

Copy the code and paste it into a file named numberguesser.html on your desktop. Save the file and then open the page in a web browser.

Now have fun playing the neat little number-guesser game you built!
